# Fully Functional Weather Dashboard

## Description

The aim of this project was to create a fully functional note taker using Express.js, which allows the user to create new notes, save them to a sidebar, and delete them. The application was deployed with Heroku and contains an introductory page and the main note taker page. The main task was to create the back-end code for the application, creating a simple API and linking this to the front-end code already present.

The features used to create this project consist of:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Express.js
- Node 
- GET requests
- POST requests
- DELETE requests
- app.use, app.get, and app.listen
- Fsutils

The deployed application can be viewed through this link - https://note-taker-express-t-d56f6cd95532.herokuapp.com/

## Installation

To use this application, type 'npm install express', 'npm install uuidv4', and 'npm install path' in your terminal to install the necessary programs.

## Usage

Once the necessary programs are installed, start the server by typing 'node server.js' in your terminal. Once on the landing page, click the button labelled 'Get Started' to be taken to the main note taker page.

Type your note title and note text into the larger text area and press the save icon on the top right when you are finished with your note and want to save it. This note will then be visible on the sidebar on the left of the page. Repeat this step for additional notes.

When on a created note, click the plus icon at the top right of the page to create a new note.

The red delete icon next to each saved note on the sidebar can be clicked to delete that corresponsing note.

When refreshed, your notes will still appear on the page, unless you manually delete them with the red delete icon.
